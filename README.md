Incredibly simple tutorial for conducting alpha diversity and beta-diversity analysis, visualization, and group-wise comparison in R. I wrote this because I was so confused by everything available on the internet and decided to dig into a bunch of documentations and blog posts to find the simplest ways to do alpha-/beta- diversity analyses!

Please check out the RMD/PDF tutorial for detailed analysis! (very simple!) If you like this repo, please star it so more people can see it!
